  "summary": "SightPath Medical, a Minneapolis, MN-based provider of specialized laser and cataract equipment, has confirmed that an unauthorized third party gained access to its internal IT systems and viewed certain files that contained the sensitive information of patients of Sutter North Surgery Center in Yuba City, CA.  The breach was detected on February 9, 2023, and the forensic investigation revealed its systems were first accessed on February 2, 2023. SightPath Medical reviewed all files potentially accessed and determined on June 14, 2023, that protected health information had been exposed. Up-to-date contact information then needed to be obtained to allow notification letters to be sent. SightPath Medical said it has implemented additional safeguards to improve the security of its systems and has offered the affected individuals complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. The exposed information included names and Social Security numbers.  The incident is not showing on the HHS\u2019 Office for Civil Rights breach portal at the time of writing. The data breach has been reported to the Maine attorney general as affecting 813 individuals.",
