At this point there is no evidence that personal data has been publicly available, only that this information has been visible to internal users should someone want to find it.   This breach occurred as a result of the implementation of the new HR and finance system and not an external cyber attack.   The system, which was introduced just before Christmas, is used by Lancashire County Council, West Lancashire Borough Council, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service and Lancashire schools and academies.
