  "summary": "Columbus Regional Healthcare System in Whiteville, NC, has notified the Maine Attorney General about a cybersecurity incident involving the theft of patient data. Unauthorized individuals had access to its network between May 19, 2023, and May 21, 2023, during which time files were removed from its network.  The file review was completed on December 28, 2023, and individual notifications have now been mailed to the affected individuals. The types of information involved varied from individual to individual and may have included names in combination with one or more of the following: Social Security number, date of birth, driver\u2019s license number, state identification number, passport number, alien registration number, financial account information, medical information (date(s) of service, treatment/diagnosis information, medical record number, patient account number, and/or prescription information) and/or health insurance policy information.  The Notification to the Maine Attorney General indicates 132,887 individuals were affected. The healthcare system said no evidence has been found to indicate any actual or attempted misuse of that data. As a precaution against identity theft and fraud, Complimentary credit monitoring services have been offered to individuals who had their Social Security numbers exposed. Columbus Regional Healthcare said it had implemented safeguards to protect against unauthorized access and continually evaluates and modifies its practices and internal controls to enhance the security and privacy of personal information.\u201d",
