According to the filing, an unauthorized user gained access to the company\u2019s computer network, including files with confidential employee information containing consumer information including names, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, passport numbers, financial account information, and protected health information.  Fresh del Monte believes that no consumer data was leaked as a result of the incident. The company launched an investigation and took its systems offline in an effort to limit further access.  Individuals affected by the information breach have already been informed by the company, and breached information varies depending on the individual.",
