  "summary": "Australia\u2019s privacy watchdog is taking Australian Clinical Labs to court over a data breach that exposed the personal information of 223,000 Australians, a week after its regulatory actions were criticised in Senate Estimates.  The ASX-listed company, which owns Medlab Pathology, is alleged to have \u201cseriously interfered with the privacy of millions of Australians by failing to take reasonable steps to protect their personal information from unauthorised access or disclosure in breach of the Privacy Act 1988\u201d between May 2021 and September 2022.  The firm collects millions of individual patients\u2019 health information as well as other personal identifying and contact information to share test results and issue invoices. This also includes copies of Medicare cards and numbers.  Federal Court proceedings follow an investigation into ACL\u2019s privacy practices. The investigation, which began in December 2022, was initiated after ACL\u2019s Medlab Pathology business disclosed a February 2022 data breach.If found guilty, Australian Clinical Labs (ACL) may be liable to pay up to $2.22 million in penalties for each contravention of the Privacy Act identified by the court.",
