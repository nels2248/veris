  "summary": "Old and shared employee passwords led to a stunning data breach at a healthcare company that compromised patient data for over 331,000 New Jersey residents, according to New Jersey Attorney General Mathew Platkin.  Platkin's office announced a multi-state settlement with New York-based Enzo Biochem, which provided diagnostic testing at laboratories in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey.  A data breach in 2023 exposed the personal data of over 2.4 million people in the U.S., including 331,600 people in New Jersey, according to Platkin.    As a result of the agreement, Platkin says Enzo will pay a $4.5 million penalty to New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, and has agreed to strengthen its data security practices.  New Jersey will receive more than $930,000 under the terms of the agreement.

Poor data security and privacy practices make it easy for cybercriminals to exploit technological vulnerabilities and gain access to sensitive health information.\"  Once the cybercriminals were logged in using the employee credentials, they installed malicious software on several of Enzo\u2019s systems.  They were then able to steal patient information that included: names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and medical treatment/diagnosis information.  Due to a lack of system monitoring, Enzo did not become aware of the attack for several days, according to Platkin.
