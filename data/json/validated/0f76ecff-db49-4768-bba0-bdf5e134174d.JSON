  "summary": "VK (VKontakte), the largest Russian social media and networking service, reportedly suffered a massive data breach that affected more than half of its users.  According to a threat actor who goes under the moniker Hikki-Chan on BreachForums, an illicit marketplace, VK suffered a massive data breach in September 2024. It posted the data almost for free for anyone to download, requiring only a few forum credits.  VK has 1.1 billion monthly visitors, which places the social network as the 23rd most visited website globally, according to Similarweb. Its audience is mostly Russian (89% of all traffic).  \u201cThis breach exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of users, including basic identification and location details,\u201d the threat actor claimed.  The listed categories of compromised data include ID number, name, surname, sex, profile image, country, and city.  The uploaded 7z archive contains 390.4 million records, which take 27.6GB of storage space when uncompressed.  \u201cWe can confirm that there have been no security breaches of any kind, including those involving personal information. VK user data is securely protected, and the content in question was collected solely from publicly available sources. This information does not contain any confidential data, but consists of details that our users have voluntarily shared on their profiles,\u201d VK said in a statement.",
