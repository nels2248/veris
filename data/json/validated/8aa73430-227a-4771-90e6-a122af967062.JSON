  "summary": "Ticketmaster appears to have suffered a huge data breach, causing it to lose sensitive data on hundreds of millions of users.  A report from Hackreadclaims a group known as ShinyHunters published a 1.3TB database of compromised customer data, on the newly-reopened BreachForums criminal site.   The database contained sensitive information on 560 million users, including payment data, but also containing people\u2019s names, postal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, ticket sales and event details, order information, and even partial payment card data, for sale. The partial payment card data includes cardholder names, the last four digits of the cards, expiration dates, and some customer fraud details. Publicity stunt  The hacking group is asking for $500,000 in exchange for the database.   Prior to offering the database for sale, ShinyHunters reached out to Ticketmaster-Live Nation in an extortion attempt, the group told Hackread - however the company allegedly did not respond to the group\u2019s attempt to communicate.
