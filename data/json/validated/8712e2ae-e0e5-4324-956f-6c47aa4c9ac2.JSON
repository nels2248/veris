  "summary": "The personal information of more than 1.3 million consumers was compromised as the result of a cyber attack on mortgage servicer LoanCare\u2019s systems.  In the November 19 attack, victims\u2019 names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and loan numbers may have been accessible, the company, owned by Fidelity National Financial, reports.  FNF says in a statement that it has \u201cnot identified any fraudulent use of personal information as a result of this incident.\u201d  \u201cWe are in the process of mailing notices to all potentially impacted borrowers by U.S. Mail,\u201d the company says in its statement. \u201cThe impacted information may vary based on the individual and is listed in the notification letter.  \u201cTo support those individuals, LoanCare has set up a special call center with a third-party vendor to address questions related to the incident. In addition, LoanCare will provide potentially impacted borrowers access to 24 months of complimentary credit monitoring, web monitoring, and identity theft restoration services at no cost. Information and instructions on how to activate these complimentary services can be found in the notification letter, along with additional steps that can be to safeguard their information online.\u201d  Last week, title insurance company First American reported that it was hit with a cyber attack on Dec. 20.  \u201cIn response, we have taken certain systems offline and are working to return to normal business operations as soon as possible,\u201d the company says on a temporary website.  \u201cFirst American\u2019s email system has been taken offline. Any recipient of an email purporting to be from First American, First American Title or from FirstAm.com should be vigilant about cybersecurity risks and avoid clicking on unknown or suspect links.\u201d  First American\u2019s websites appeared to still be offline Tuesday afternoon.  No word yet on the nature of the First American attack.",
