The compromise was revealed on Wednesday afternoon, when the digital library\u2019s website began showing a JavaScript pop-up saying: \u201cHave you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!\u201d  Around the same time, the data in question was being loaded into the Have I Been Pwned? data breach notification service and, soon after, HIBP users who signed up for notifications when their data is leaked began receiving notices via email",
