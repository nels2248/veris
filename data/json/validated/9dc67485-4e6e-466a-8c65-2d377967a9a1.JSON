  "summary": "An investigation determined the Hillsborough County Supervisors of Elections Office underwent an illegal data breach in early May, exposing more than 50,000 voters' information.  An unauthorized user appeared to have illegally accessed and copied files containing personal identification information, such as social security or driver's license numbers, the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Office said in a news release. The user was able to gather the information from files used to conduct voter registration list maintenance.  \"Voter registration list maintenance is the state-mandated process by which the office continually reviews its voter roll to identify necessary updates,\" a news release reads. \"It's important to note that the voter registration system and the ballot tabulation system, which have additional layers of security, were not accessed.\"",
