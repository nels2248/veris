  "summary": "The chief exec at NHS Dumfries and Galloway will write to thousands of folks in the Scottish region whose data was stolen by criminals, admitting the lot of it was published after the health authority board did not give in to the miscreants' demands.  Residents of Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland will soon be receiving a letter from the CEO of the regional National Health Service org explaining in full the February cyberattack that may affect them.  Draft copies of the letters to be sent this week were posted on NHS Dumfries and Galloway's website on Monday. It explains in plain terms what happened, what the attack means for residents, and how to stay safe online in the wake of the incident.  \"In February this year, NHS Dumfries and Galloway was the victim of a targeted attack by cybercriminals,\" said Julie White, chief exec at NHS Dumfries and Galloway, in the letter [PDF]. \"This did not interrupt the care provided to patients, and no data on our systems was deleted or changed. However, the criminals were able to access and copy large amounts of patient and staff-identifiable data.  \"When their demands weren't met, they published the stolen files onto the internet on May 6, 2024. We are advising people in Dumfries and Galloway that the best approach to take is to assume that some data relating to you is likely to have been copied and published.",
