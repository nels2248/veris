  "summary": "Grafton police are warning residents that their credit card information may have been stolen after police found a \u201cskimming\u201d device on a local store\u2019s card processor.  According to a statement by the police department, the skimming device was placed over the credit card processor at a Koopman Lumber store. Skimming devices are designed to fit over the existing pay pad and force customers to swipe their card, where criminals can then copy and steal the card\u2019s information.  The device was found because it prevented the machine from properly communicating with the store\u2019s payment system. The pad was sent back to the IT department, where the criminal device was found. Every pad at the nine other Koopman Lumber locations were also checked.",
