  "summary": "Major crypto exchange Huobi has quietly fixed a data breach in which a bad actor could have stolen user assets, spread malware, learned the IP address of every over-the-counter (OTC) trader since 2017, and identified nearly 5,000 crypto whales on the platform, according to a white hat hacker.  Citizen journalist Aaron Phillips discovered the data breach occurred in the summer of 2021, when Huobi accidentally shared a file containing AWS credentials. However, after learning about the breach in 2022, it took Phillips an entire year to get the exchange to confirm that the breach had been fixed.  \u201cFor two years, every user who logged into a Huobi website or app was potentially at risk of losing their account,\u201d the citizen journalist wrote.  \u201cAn attacker exploiting Huobi\u2019s mistakes would have had the opportunity to carry out the largest crypto theft in history.\u201d",
