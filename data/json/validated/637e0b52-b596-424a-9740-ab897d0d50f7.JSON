  "summary": "The American healthcare service MedStar has suffered a breach, with attackers gaining access to the personal information of 183,000 patients.  MedStar, a major US healthcare provider, had its systems penetrated, and threat actors accessed personal patient data alongside health insurance information. Notification letters were mailed to relevant patients on May 3rd, 2023.  The information that may have been involved includes some or all of the following:  Names Mailing addresses Dates of birth Dates of service Providers names Health insurance information Individual healthcare data can be sold for hundreds of dollars on dark web forums. Malicious actors can use medical details for medical identity theft, a type of fraud where threat actors use stolen information to submit forged claims to Medicare and other health insurers.  Meanwhile, other personally identifiable information (PII) may be used to commit fraud, from identity theft and phishing attacks to opening new credit accounts, making unauthorized purchases, or obtaining loans under false pretenses.  MedStar discovered that an unauthorized party had \u201caccessed emails and files associated with three MedStar employee email accounts.\u201d  The unauthorized access supposedly occurred intermittently between January and October of 2023.  The company ran an investigation, which finished in March 2024, and found that some personal patient information was \u201cincluded in the emails and files that were accessed.\u201d  However, MedStar states they have \u201cno reason to believe that patient information was actually acquired or viewed.\u201d The company also acknowledges that they \u201ccannot rule out such access.\u201d  MedStar apologizes for any concern or inconvenience this may have caused and urges its patients to \u201creview statements they received related to their healthcare.\u201d  \u201cWe take this matter very seriously,\u201d the healthcare provider said.  MedStar supposedly employs \u201cappropriate physical, technical, and administrative controls to ensure the safety and confidentiality of patients\u2019 information.\u201d The company has implemented further safeguarding practices and security measures to \u201cprevent something like this from happening again.\u201d  MedStar offers healthcare services in the US, specifically in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington DC, via its 10 hospitals and 300 other care locations.  The healthcare service employs almost 4,000 physicians and has a net operating revenue of $7.7 billion.",
