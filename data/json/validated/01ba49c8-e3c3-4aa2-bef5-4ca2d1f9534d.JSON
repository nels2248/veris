  "summary": "Smartphone payment provider LINE Pay announced yesterday that around 133,000 users' payment details were mistakenly published on GitHub between September and November of this year.  Files detailing participants in a LINE Pay promotional program staged between late December 2020 and April 2021 were accidentally uploaded to the collaborative coding cr\u00e8che by a research group employee.  Among the leaked details were the date, time, and amount of transactions, plus user and franchise store identification numbers. Although names, addresses, telephone, credit card and bank account numbers were not shared, the names of the users and other details could be traced with a little effort.  The information \u2013 which covered of over 51,000 Japanese users and almost 82,000 Taiwanese and Thai users \u2013 was accessed 11 times during the ten weeks it was available online.",
