Berry, Dunn, McNeil & Parker on Thursday submitted a data breach notification to the Maine attorney general's office stating that it is notifying 1.1 million U.S. residents that such information as their name, address and driver's license number or non-driver identification card number was exposed in the data breach.  The breach involved BerryDunn's Health Analytics Practice Group. Portland-based BerryDunn couldn't be immediately reached for comment about whether the breach exposed any other personal identifiable details for individuals, such as health information. The company is offering all affected individuals at least 12 months of prepaid identity theft monitoring.",
