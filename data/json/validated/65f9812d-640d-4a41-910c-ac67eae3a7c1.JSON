  "summary": "Ziv Medical Center, HQ: Derech Harambam, Safed, Israel, EMP: 132, NAICS: 622110 (General Medical and Surgical Hospital). On Nov 27, 2024, hacker groups, \u201cMalek Team\u201d and \u201cAGRIUS\u201d, allegedly linked to Iranian Intelligence Ministry, and Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cLebanese Cedar\u201d cyber unit, stole 700,000 (500 gigabytes of data) medical records from a cyberattack, of those, 100,000 are IDF patient records. \u201cMalek Team\u201d posted screen shots of the data on their Telegram page. This was the third time Ziv fell victim to a cyberattack in four months. Data included patient\u2019s personal and medical information such as diseases and prescribed drugs, and passport pictures. As a precautionary measure, Ziv implemented various new safeguards, temporarily restricting the sending and receiving of external emails. Certain computer services were also temporarily disconnected. The public is urged to exercise caution when receiving messages purporting to be from the hospital and to avoid opening any suspicious messages or clicking on any attached links. NOTE: Mohammed Ali Marai was identified as the lead operator for the Hezbollah hacking group.",
