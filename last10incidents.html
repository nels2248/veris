According to school officials, their information technology team detected unusual activity on the school’s network last Friday.  Due to the unusual activity, the school’s Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) intentionally shut down the university’s network to investigate. WASHINGTON D.C. (7News) — Howard University announced Monday that they are investigating a ransomware attack and canceled classes Tuesday. Now, university officials are canceling online and hybrid classes Wednesday, too. In-person classes will take place.  According to school officials, their information technology team detected unusual activity on the school's network last Friday.  Due to the unusual activityOnline and hybrid classes will be canceled again Wednesday so that the IT team has more time to investigate the incident. The campus will be open to essential employees only.  "This is a highly dynamic situation, and it is our priority to protect all sensitive personal, research, and clinical data. We are in contact with the FBI and the D.C. city government, and we are installing additional safety measures to further protect the University’s and your personal data from any criminal ciphering," university officials say.  Howard sophomore Tahir Scott expressed his frustration with having no WIFI, saying he cannot do homework as often because so much of it is online. “[We were told to] change our password, check our user name make sure nobody’s trying to use it to log in,” Scott said.  Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analysist for the cyber security firm, Recorded Future, says ransomware attacks frequently occur around holidays, noting the Colonial Pipeline attack that took place on Mother's Day weekend.  “Colleges and universities have become much more attractive to ransomware groups because they can demand higher payment," Liska said. Recorded Future says this is the 20th attack against a college or university just this year.  The school shared this information with its community:  All online and hybrid undergraduate courses remain suspended for tomorrow, Wednesday, September 8, and the physical campus will be open to essential employees only. All in-person undergraduate, graduate, professional, and clinical experiential courses will resume as scheduled tomorrow, Wednesday, September 8.

There was a cyber attack on the Neuchâtel Cantonal Bank (BCN) at the beginning of August, spokeswoman Marie-Laure Chapatte, told the «AWP» news agency (in German), resulting in the potential theft of around 1,500 email addresses.  Neither the banking infrastructure - such as the online banking platform - nor other sensitive systems were affected by the attack on August 4 and 5, the bank added.   BCN said the attack was «contained quickly». There was also no attempt at extortion or ransom demands as in ransomware attacks.  Nothing of Value Taken?  The attackers succeeded in exploiting a vulnerability in the BCN website that has since been dealt with. An external expert was brought in to analyze the situation more thoroughly.  «The bank believes it is adequately protected from the threat of a cyber-attack,» the spokeswoman said.  Some of the information that the hackers accessed was old and dates back to 2012.  «Due to the poor quality of the data, we were unable to contact those potentially affected because we could not always identify them,» Chapatte added.  That sounds alarming, but all in all the bank thinks it is in a position to identify those potentially affected.

The document also included associated dates for sick days/leave, as well as more specific details in some cases, such as the reason for the absence.   Diskey, who has worked for the City for nearly 40 years, replied to Clark’s email in a forward to all members of the Corporate Leadership Team but inadvertently included a copy of the Master Sick Report. In response to receipt of the email and attachment, the incident was reported to the City Clerk and Information, Access and Privacy Officer that day.  The City Clerk received confirmation from all members of the Corporate Leadership Team that the record at issue has been destroyed.

The 1.9 million-strong recordset contained sensitive information on people, including their names, country citizenship, gender, date of birth, passport details, and no-fly status.  The exposed server was indexed by search engines Censys and ZoomEye, indicating Diachenko may not have been the only person to come across the list: Additionally, the researcher noticed some elusive fields such as "tag," "nomination type," and "selectee indicator," that weren't immediately understood by him.  "That was the only valid guess given the nature of data plus there was a specific field named 'TSC_ID'," Diachenko told BleepingComputer, which hinted to him the source of the recordset could be the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC).  FBI's TSC is used by multiple federal agencies to manage and share consolidated information for counterterrorism purposes.  The agency maintains the classified watchlist called the Terrorist Screening Database, sometimes also referred to as the "no-fly list."

DuPage Medical Group is the largest independent physician group in Illinois.  Patients’ personal information may include names, address­es, dates of birth, diag­no­sis codes and information on medical procedures and treatment dates. The hackers may have accessed the Social Security num­bers for a smaller number of people, the medical group announced in a news release.  “To date, DMG has no evi­dence that any infor­ma­tion has been sub­ject to actu­al or attempt­ed mis­use as a result of this inci­dent. This event did not impact finan­cial account numbers,” the medical group said. DMG became aware of the security breach July 13 and is working with cyber-forensic specialists to “deter­mine the full nature and scope of the inci­dent.”  The “security incident” caused by “unauthorized actors” disrupted the medical group’s computer network. The unauthorized access occurred July 12 and 13.  “On August 17, 2021, we deter­mined that cer­tain files stored with­in our envi­ron­ment that con­tained patient infor­ma­tion may have been impact­ed by this incident,” the medical group said.

May Brooks-Kempler of the Think Safe Cyber Facebook group estimates that about 280,000 current or former students may have had their personal information stolen, according to The Jerusalem Post.  AcadeME is a nationwide service provider that offers support for students looking for jobs throughout 11,000 different businesses. On June 20, it became the victim of a pro-Palestinian Malaysian hacking group known as "DragonForce".  While AcadeME has denied the allegation, the attached code screenshots, server addresses, and a table containing email addresses and names say otherwise. Essentially, the evidence suggests that students' phone numbers, addresses, full names, emails, and passwords have been compromised.  The hackers wrote on Telegram, "This is an urgent call for all Hackers, Human Right Organizations and Activists all around the world to unite again and start campaign against Israhell, share what is really going on there, expose their terrorist activity to the world [...] We will never remain silent against israhell war activity".  Hackers claim to have made Israeli passports public  Cyberattacks on Israeli businesses and organizations have increased in frequency during the past year, affecting firms such as Amital software, Ami Insurance, and Israel Aerospace Industries. In fact, earlier on Friday, the same organization conducted DDoS attacks against Israeli institutions, including the Bank of Israel, Bank Leumi, and Mizrahi Tefahot. The cybercriminals also claimed to have released a large number of Israeli passports on the same day.  At the beginning of this year, Israel's National Cyber Directorate (INCD) head Yigal Unna expressed concern about hackers' ability to damage Israeli academic institutions, if proper measures are not taken. The director of the INCD voiced his worry that the extensive ties between academic institutions and other bodies and organizations may pose a threat to other bodies and organizations, resulting in their legal liability. <br>asset.assets: [{'variety': 'S - Web application'}]<br>asset.cloud: ['Unknown']<br>attribute.confidentiality.data: [{'variety': 'Personal'}]<br>attribute.confidentiality.data_disclosure: Yes<br>attribute.confidentiality.data_total: 280000.0<br>plus.analysis_status: Reviewed<br>plus.analyst: Hylender<br>plus.dbir_year: 2022.0<br>plus.master_id: 66cf9480-ded6-4548-8b72-d12e8aca83b3<br>timeline.incident.day: 20.0<br>timeline.incident.month: 6.0<br>timeline.incident.year: 2021<br>victim.country: ['IL']<br>victim.employee_count: Unknown<br>victim.government: ['NA']<br>victim.industry: 561311<br>victim.region: ['142145']<br>victim.victim_id: AcadeME<br>confidence: High<br>schema_name: vcdb<br>targeted: Targeted<br>asset.role: ['IT']<br>attribute.confidentiality.data_victim: ['Customer']<br>attribute.confidentiality.state: ['Stored unencrypted']<br>discovery_method.external.variety: ['Actor disclosure']<br>plus.event_chain: [{'action': 'hak', 'actor': 'ext', 'asset': 'srv', 'attribute': 'cp', 'summary': 'attacker gained access via unknown hacking and exfiltrated data'}]<br>plus.github: 17843<br>plus.timeline.notification.day: 28.0<br>plus.timeline.notification.month: 6.0<br>plus.timeline.notification.year: 2021.0<br>actor.external.country: ['MY']<br>actor.external.motive: ['Ideology']<br>actor.external.region: ['142035']<br>actor.external.variety: ['Activist']<br>action.hacking.variety: ['Unknown']<br>action.hacking.vector: ['Web application']<br>plus.attribute.confidentiality.data_abuse: Yes<br>actor.external.name: ['Dragon Force']<br>incident_date: 2021-06-20 00:00:00
